In general earthquakes have devasting effects and aftermath shock waves,we would like to find whether the below features of building has impact with damage level.

Here our hypothesis would be

Hypothesis :
What are locations that has impact with damge level of building?
H0:Geo ids have inpact towards damage level of building.
H1:Geo ids doesnot have inpact towards damage level of building.
 
Hypothesis :
What is the floor count which has severe impact?
H0:High floor count building ie:building floors more than ? has extreme damage.
H1:Low floor count building ie:building floors less than ? has extreme damage.

Hypothesis :
What is the min
 age of building that has incurred severe damage? 
H0:Age of building greater than ? yrs incur extreme damage.
H1:Age of building less than ? yrs incur extreme damage.

Hypothesis :
What portion of families live in extreme damage buildings?
H0:Majority of families live in buildings which suffers high damage level.
H1:Majority of families live in buildings which suffer average damage level.

Hypothesis :
Does Area percentage has impact with extreme damage?
What percentage is optimum value for low and average damage?
H0:Area % less than optimum value accounts for sev dmg.
H1:Area % more than optimum value accounts for sev dmg.
